1. what is version control? <br>
it keeps trackes to your work or footprint over the process of making project and product
(to manage the version of the software)

#version control is always distributed becaus the changes are always being happend

2. stages of files or status? <br>
<ol>
  <li>modified</li>
  <li>staged</li>
  <li>commited</li>
</ol>
A. git local  <br>
1. check installetion -> open terminal -> git --version  <br> 
2. configure it with github ->go to github -> and in terminal config <br>
3. (a) git config --global user.email "----||----"  <br> (b) git config --global user.name "vaibhavScodr" <br> <br>
4.Now there are two ways to do this in order to work with github <br> (1) you can make the repo on the git hub and can clone it on the vs code by using <h3>git clone "--link--"</h3> <br>
(2) second you can do what that make your own diretory over the VS code and run and write everything on it than make it take it in the github by using <h3>git init</h3> 
also you can check it by using ls -a. <br>
5. Now becaus you have connected to the github and have proper connection so just make some handy command which are (a)git status--> git add .--> git commit -m "some msg"--> git push origin main.. <br>
